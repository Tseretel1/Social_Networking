# Social Networking

## About
The Social Networking application is built on the .NET console using Entity Framework. 
It offers all the key interaction functionalities found in other social apps. Here, users can post, 
follow other users, befriend them, send messages, remove followers or friends, and decline follow requests. 
In short, it encompasses all the major functionalities required for a social app, albeit without a frontend interface.
